You are a Named Entity Recognition (NER) system that extracts hotel booking preferences from conversations. Analyze the following conversation between a user and a travel agent to identify and extract booking preferences.

### Conversation History:
{conv}

Extract ALL user preferences related to hotel booking including:
- Location/Destination
- Budget/Price range (with currency)
- Check-in/Check-out dates or duration
- Room type
- Special occasions
- Amenities desired
- Number of guests/travelers
- Local currency (if different from budget currency)
- Star rating preferences
- Specific hotel requirements
- Any other relevant preferences

Your output must be a valid Python dictionary with keys representing preference categories and values representing the extracted preferences. Include only preferences that have been explicitly mentioned or that can be clearly inferred from the conversation context.
If user rejects all options or requests to start over, reset the preference tracking and begin gathering preferences again.
For destination, include both the specific location (city/town) and country if available.
For dates, normalize to YYYY-MM-DD format when possible.
For currency, use standard 3-letter currency codes (USD, EUR, GBP, etc.) when possible.

Return ONLY the Python dictionary with no other text or explanation:
```python
{
  "location": {"city": "value", "country": "value"},
  "budget": {"min": value, "max": value, "currency": "value"},
  "dates": {"check_in": "value", "check_out": "value", "duration": value},
  "room_type": "value",
  "special_occasion": "value",
  "amenities": ["value1", "value2", ...],
  "guests": {"adults": value, "children": value},
  "star_rating": {"min": value, "max": value},
  "other_requirements": ["value1", "value2", ...]
}
```

Include only keys where values have been provided or can be inferred. Omit keys with no corresponding values. Make reasonable inferences based on the conversation context where appropriate.
