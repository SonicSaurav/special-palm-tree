#### **Evaluation Task:**


Scrutinize the provided output <output_to_evaluate> against the comprehensive guidelines in <original_prompt> across the following dimensions. Your evaluation should be detailed, specific, and balanced:


**Note:** If no search results are present in the assistant's response, you should focus your evaluation on the other criteria (question format, conversational quality, contextual intelligence, etc.) and adjust scoring accordingly. The search handling criteria (30%) would be excluded from your evaluation in this case, and the weights of other criteria should be proportionally increased.


1. **Adherence to Search Result Handling (30%)**
   - For >10 matches: Does the agent avoid recommending specific hotels/pricing and instead offer filtering options?
   - For 3-10 matches: Does the agent inform the user of the exact number and show only top 3 hotels?
   - For ≤2 matches: Does the agent show all available matches and ask about relaxing constraints?
   - Exception handling: If user explicitly requests results despite >10 matches, does the agent show top 3 while noting they're a small selection?


2. **Question Format & Pacing (25%)**
   - Strictly asks only ONE question at a time
   - For multiple-choice questions: Provides up to four concise (10-15 word) options with brief descriptions
   - For open-ended questions: Poses without multiple-choice options
   - Does not overwhelm user with multiple questions in a single response


3. **Conversational Quality (20%)**
   - Maintains natural, friendly travel agent tone throughout
   - Acknowledges special occasions (Honeymoon, Anniversary, etc.) exactly once when mentioned
   - Shows enthusiasm and helpfulness appropriate for a travel agent
   - Immediately addresses any direct user questions when asked


4. **Contextual Intelligence (15%)**
   - Asks logical follow-up questions based on conversation history
   - Doesn't repeat questions for information already provided
   - Gathers information efficiently to narrow hotel search parameters
   - Adapts approach based on user's expressed preferences


5. **Overall Effectiveness (10%)**
   - Would this response effectively move the hotel booking process forward?
   - Balance between gathering necessary information and providing helpful recommendations
   - Practical utility for a real user seeking hotel accommodations

#### **Scoring Rubric (Scale 1 to 10):**


## When Search Results ARE Present:


**1. Adherence to Search Result Handling (30%, 3.0 points)**
- **Perfect (3.0 points):**
  - Precisely adheres to match count rules (e.g., clearly communicates the number of matches).
  - Expertly manages **Features_With_High_Variability** by suggesting filtering options instead of direct recommendations when matches exceed 10.
- **Good (2.5–2.9 points):**
  - Generally clear about the number of available hotel matches, with minor ambiguities.
  - Mostly correct handling of **Features_With_High_Variability**, occasionally suggesting specific hotels when filtering should have been recommended.
- **Average (1.8–2.4 points):**
  - Noticeable shortcomings in explicitly stating matches count or adhering to hotel presentation guidelines.
  - Moderate errors in handling variability, occasionally recommending direct hotels despite having >10 matches.
- **Poor (1.0–1.7 points):**
  - Significant mistakes in presenting the number of search results or appropriate use of filtering.
  - Frequent direct recommendations made incorrectly when variability should have required filtering suggestions.
- **Failing (<1.0 points):**
  - Completely disregards guidelines for presenting search results.
  - Ignores handling of variability entirely, consistently making inappropriate or confusing direct recommendations irrespective of hotel match count.




### **2. Question Format & Pacing (25%, 2.5 points)**


- **Perfect (2.5 points):**
  - Asks exactly **one** clearly structured question per response.
  - Flawlessly chooses between MCQ/open-ended formats, perfectly matching the question nature (e.g., always provides MCQ if question naturally fits multiple-choice criteria; strictly open-ended otherwise).
  - MCQs strictly contain up to four distinct, concise, clearly described options; open-ended questions never contain suggested answers.
- **Good (2.0–2.4 points):**
  - Mostly adheres to the single-question rule; slight imperfections in wording or minor formatting issues.
  - Minor mismatch: occasionally provides open-ended questions that could clearly benefit from MCQ formatting, or slightly unclear MCQ option descriptions.
- **Average (1.5–1.9 points):**
  - Noticeable violations of single-question rule (borderline multiple questions asked).
  - Significant mismatch between open-ended and MCQ formatting: a clear MCQ-suited question returned in open-ended format, noticeably reducing clarity and usability.
- **Poor (1.0–1.4 points):**
  - Serious breach of the single-question rule (multiple confusing questions simultaneously).
  - Major MCQ/open-ended format misalignment: explicitly clear MCQ candidate question presented incorrectly as open-ended or vice versa, severely impacting user experience.
- **Failing (<1.0 points):**
  - Completely ignores single-question requirement, repeatedly overwhelming users.
  - Extremely poor judgment on question type: consistently delivers open-ended questions when an MCQ was explicitly obvious and necessary, making the conversation confusing or counterproductive.




### **3. Conversational Quality (20%, 2.0 points)**


- **Perfect (2.0 points):**
  - Consistently friendly, professionally enthusiastic, highly engaging.
  - Special occasions acknowledged immediately, exactly once, with clear personalization.
- **Good (1.5–1.9 points):**
  - Generally maintains professional tone; minor inconsistency or mild artificiality occasionally.
  - Slightly delayed or generic acknowledgment of special occasions; lacks some enthusiasm or warmth.
- **Average (1.0–1.4 points):**
  - Noticeably robotic or awkward in tone multiple times.
  - Clearly misses or awkwardly handles special occasions; delayed responses to user questions causing mild frustration.
- **Poor (0.5–0.9 points):**
  - Frequently robotic, abrupt, or unprofessionally casual.
  - Repeatedly ignores special occasions or clearly disregards direct user inquiries, leading to noticeable confusion or dissatisfaction.
- **Failing (<0.5 points):**
  - Consistently inappropriate or dismissive tone; significantly damages the user-agent interaction.
  - Completely overlooks user’s special occasions or direct questions, resulting in serious conversational failure.




### **4. Contextual Intelligence (15%, 1.5 points)**


- **Perfect (1.5 points):**
  - Completely context-aware; logical, relevant follow-up questions based strictly on prior conversation.
  - Absolutely no repetition; efficiently moves conversation forward without repeating user-provided details.
  - Never redundantly acknowledges user’s earlier messages verbatim (e.g., avoids repeating “Goa from tomorrow for 2 nights” exactly as user stated).
- **Good (1.2–1.4 points):**
  - Generally context-aware; minor redundancy or slightly inefficient follow-ups present.
  - Rare, slight re-acknowledgment of user input without harming overall conversation clarity.
- **Average (0.8–1.1 points):**
  - Noticeably repetitive acknowledgment; occasionally repeats user messages unnecessarily, slightly hindering flow.
  - Moderate redundancy in follow-ups, weakening the efficiency of information collection.
- **Poor (0.4–0.7 points):**
  - Frequent, unnecessary repetition of user input; consistently echoes exact phrases, creating clear redundancy.
  - Poor understanding of context; repetitive and illogical follow-up questions significantly impede conversation progress.
- **Failing (<0.4 points):**
  - Constantly repeats user-provided messages verbatim; shows complete disregard for prior interactions.
  - Severely context-unaware; irrelevant or repetitive acknowledgments severely disrupt booking conversation.




### **5. Overall Effectiveness (10%, 1.0 point)**


- **Perfect (1.0 points):**
  - Response explicitly and effectively advances booking; user clearly understands next actionable steps.
  - Perfect balance between question clarity and practical recommendation; no ambiguity.
- **Good (0.8–0.9 points):**
  - Slight imperfections in clarity or mild ambiguity, yet conversation still effectively progresses toward booking.
- **Average (0.6–0.7 points):**
  - Response marginally advances the conversation, leaving the user with uncertainty about next steps.
  - Moderately unclear or inefficient in guiding the user toward a clear booking action.
- **Poor (0.3–0.5 points):**
  - Barely moves the booking forward; user is likely confused or uncertain about how to proceed.
  - Unclear or confusing response, significantly reducing practical effectiveness.
- **Failing (<0.3 points):**
  - Ineffective; the response either stalls the booking process or actively confuses the user.
  - Response significantly regresses or disrupts the booking process, making further progression difficult or impossible.

#### **Important Instructions:**


- **Search Result Focus:** Pay special attention to how the agent handles different numbers of search results (>10, 3-10, ≤2) when search results are present.
- **When No Search Results:** If search results are absent, focus evaluation on information gathering, question format, and conversational quality.
- **One Question Rule:** Be particularly strict about the "one question at a time" requirement in all scenarios.
- **Context-Aware Analysis:** Consider the entire conversation history when evaluating the appropriateness of the agent's response.
- **Special Occasion Tracking:** Check if special occasions are acknowledged exactly once without repetition.
- **Strict Formatting:** Ensure your final response is a valid JSON object with the structure specified above.
- **Zero Redundancy:** Avoid reiterating context; focus solely on the precise evaluation of the travel agent's response.
- **MCQ Check:** Ensure the question is best suited for MCQ or Open Ended.
- **Scoring:** Each category should be scored in accordance with its weight (e.g., adherence_to_search is 30% of total, so score out of 3.0).
- **Think deeply before giving even 0.1 Point.**
- **total_score** will be out of 10 and it will be sum of all the scores that you gave before calculating it.


Remember, think carefully and deliberately about the problem. Take as much time as you need. I will be very sad if you answer quickly and get it wrong.
